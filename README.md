# 🌩️ Tara Schofield | TaraScho  

👋 I love all things cloud, IaC, and cloudsec.

## 👩‍💻 Interests

**Cloud Computing** – Cloud architectures, serverless and event driven architectures

**Infrastructure as Code** – At my happiest when writing CDK or Terraform, but I do have a soft spot for a nice YAML CloudFormation template. If you can't handle me at my `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS` you don't deserve me at my `CREATE_COMPLETE`

**Cloud Security/Cybersecurity** - Used to be a consultant, now I build cloud security labs, workshops, and gamified learning @Datadog

**CI/CD/DevSecOps/Automation** 

**Gamified Learning/CTFs/Practical Assessment** 

## 🔧 Favorites 

- ☁️ AWS | GCP | Working on my Azure skills  
- 📜 Terraform | CDK | CloudFormation
- 🖌️ Python | TypeScript | Learning Go | Astro | A pinch of React

## 💬 My LinkedIn message response time is 2 minutes or 2 weeks - there is no in between
